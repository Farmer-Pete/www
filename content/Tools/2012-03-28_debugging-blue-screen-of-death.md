BlueScreenView to the rescue
-----------------------------

Attempting to debug a "[Blue Screen of Death][BSOD]" [crash](tag:crash) on [windows](tag:windows) can be a timely and frustrating process. However, [BlueScreenView][]Â ([free](tag:free)) by [Nirsoft][] really helps in the debugging process. Microsoft does provide various crash analyzers, but I found BlueScreenView the easiest to use ( and fastest to install; just unzip and run ) `:)`
