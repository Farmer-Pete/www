Summary: If you think you have sleep apnea, but don't want to take a sleep study, the Sleep Strip could be a convenient way to diagnose your sleep apnea

An easier diagnosis
-------------------

My father has [sleep apnea][] and I suspected that I had it as well. I wanted to find out ( and get treatment ) but I was resistant to going for a sleep study for several reasons:

1. Cost for the sleep study (couple/several thousand which insurance might or night not cover)
2. Time involved of staying overnight
3. The idea of being hooked up to electrodes and observed while I slept was just plain creepy

Because of this, I started researching at-home tests that I could do. That is when I stumbled across the "[Sleep Strip][]", a nifty mini-computer that tests you for apnea. Obviously, it is not as conclusive as going to a sleep study, but it provided several big advantages:

Not nearly as obtrusive
:   The strip has the footprint of a pencil and sticks to your upper lip. It took a little getting used to, but I quickly forgot it was there and fell asleep

Can be done at home
:   I was able to do this in the comfort and privacy of my own bed

Cheaper
:   Insurance didn't pay for the test but then again it was around $50 vs. thousands

Instant results
:   After you wake up and conclude the test, you get a number which indicates the severity of your apnea (0 = no apnea ... 3 = severe apnea)

Drawbacks
---------

However there are a couple of drawbacks that you should be aware of:

Not conclusive
:   As stated above, your result is a number indicating the severity of your [sleep apnea](tag:sleep_apnea). During a sleep study you would get a lot more information and the doctor would be able to see patterns and the entire time line of the night you are studied

May not be accepted
:   I had trouble getting a dental device for my [sleep apnea](tag:sleep_apnea) since I hadn't taken a sleep study. In the end, they billed it as a "cure for snoring" instead of apnea and I was able to get the device. You should look into if a sleep study is required for the treatment you are interested in, especially If you are looking into getting a [CPAP][] machine.

Overall impression
------------------

Overall, I loved the little device and I'm glad that I used the [Sleep Strip][] and was able to get treatment without taking a sleep study.
